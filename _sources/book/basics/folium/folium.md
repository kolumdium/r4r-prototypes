# Folium

Folium is a Python library used for visualizing geospatial data. It is built on the data manipulation library `pandas` and the mapping library `leaflet.js`. It is used to visualize data that has been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing `vincent/Vega` visualizations as markers on the map.
