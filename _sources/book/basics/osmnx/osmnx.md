# OSMNX

OSMNX is a Python package that lets you download and work with OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. It is built on top of the NetworkX package, which is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks. OSMNX is a powerful tool for working with OSM data, and it provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for downloading and working with OSM data.

Currently OSMNX is doing a major update to 2.0. This Book will use stable Version 1.9.x as of 2024-08-02. But we will convert the code to 2.0 as soon as it is stable. Testing with 2.0.0 beta didn't show any issues.
